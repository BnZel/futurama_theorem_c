## Futurama Theorem C

First iteration of a full code cleanup. Branched out in case you want to refer back to the original source.

## Info
* Re-organized majority of the code on main to separate functions:
    - ```print_people(struct Person *people, int num_people, int start)```
    - ```swap(struct Person *p1, struct Person *p2)```
    - ```initialize_helpers(struct Person *x, struct Person *y, int size)```
    - ```unshuffle_first_cycle(struct Person *helper_1, struct Person *helper_2, struct Person *people, int size)```
    - ```unshuffle_second_cycle(struct Person *helper_1, struct Person *helper_2, struct Person *people, int size)```
    - ```initialize_people(int num_people)```
    - ```initialize(void)```
